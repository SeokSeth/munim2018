    <h3>HISTORICAL SECURITY COUNCIL (HSC)<br>
Role of the Historical Security Council:</h3><br>
<h4>
The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is a permanent council established by the UN Charter, with the sole purpose of maintaining international peace and security. It is composed of 15 members; 5 permanent members (referred to as the P5 nations; United States, USSR (Russia), China (replaced Taiwan after UNSC Resolution 2758 in 1971), France and the UK) and 10 non-permanent members (elected every two years). The UNSC is the only council that can force a nation to do something, as long as it passes in a Resolution (Article 25). For a Resolution to pass within the UNSC, there must be 9 votes in favor, and none of the P5 nation may veto the resolution. Furthermore, if a member of the UNSC is directly involved in a dispute being debated within the UNSC, then that member may only abstain from voting on any resolution regarding that dispute (Paragraph 3, Article 27). The UNCS may also establish sub-committees to aid its efforts, and can call for investigations of fact-finding missions (through the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights (OHCHR)) to obtain more information on a dispute (keep this in mind when writing your resolutions).<br><br>
â€‹     Within Model UN (MUN), the Historical Security Council (HSC) is essentially the same thing as the Security Council; however, instead of debating current disputes, the HSC debates historical disputes at the time they occurred.
